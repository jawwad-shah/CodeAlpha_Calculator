# 🛸 Precision Calculator 2026

A high-fidelity, tactile digital calculator engineered for professional workflows. Unlike typical "glowy" or "AI-styled" projects, this focuses on **Industrial Sophistication**—combining a deep monochromatic aesthetic with high-end physical feedback.

## 🛠 Features

* **Tactile UI Physics:** Buttons designed with 2026 motion standards, featuring recessed states and physical depth.
* **Industrial Dark Theme:** Zero-saturation palette (Charcoal, Silver, and Obsidian) for zero eye strain.
* **Precision Engine:** Advanced error handling for edge cases like division by zero and decimal overflow.
* **Hybrid Navigation:** Full desktop keyboard support (NumPad ready) with `Enter`, `Escape`, and `Backspace` mapping.
* **No Framework Bloat:** Pure 1:1 implementation using optimized Vanilla JavaScript, CSS Grid, and Semantic HTML5.

## 🕹 Getting Started

No build tools, no npm nightmares. Just pure performance.

1. **Clone the Repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/precision-calculator.git

```


2. **Launch:**
Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `0-9` | Input Digits |

## 🏗 Technical Architecture

├── index.html      # Structural layer with Semantic HTML
├── style.css       # 2026 Industrial UI Logic (Custom Properties)
└── script.js       # State Machine & Event Bus

```

* **Logic:** Uses a state-based approach to manage `currentInput`, `previousInput`, and `operator` memory.
* **Styling:** Implements a monochromatic design system using CSS Variables for easy white-labeling.
* **Optimization:** Zero external dependencies (except for FontAwesome icons and Google Fonts).

## 💎 Design Philosophy

This project rejects the "over-saturated" trends of the early 2020s. We use **Monochromatic Depth** to create a tool that feels like a piece of high-end hardware on your screen. The focus is on content, contrast, and clarity.
